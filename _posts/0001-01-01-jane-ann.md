# Jane-Ann Meehan

As the owner of the clinic I believe in providing a quality and professional service. My practise aims to provide you, the client, with a specialised individually tailored service.

My main areas of interest are in sports specific injuries and biomechanical pathologies. As a competitive athlete myself and having worked with athletics Ireland I believe preventing injuries through screening athletes is the way forward. I have researched lower limb pathologies extensively in both my primary physiotherapy degree and in my Sports Medicine Masters. I consider myself a hands on physiotherapist who rarely uses machines for treatment. I believe in educating each client about their injury with a view to preventing it happening again. 

I look forward to welcoming you into our state of the art facilities.
