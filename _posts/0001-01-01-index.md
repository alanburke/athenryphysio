Welcome to Athenry Physiotherapy &amp; Performance clinic, located within the new purpose built Raheen medical centre.

The physiotherapy clinic was founded by Jane-Ann Meehan in April 2011 and has subsequently developed into a specialised multidisciplinary service. The clinic provides four private treatment rooms and an open plan gym/rehabilitation area.

A variety of physiotherapy services are provided including sports specific performance screening, womenâ€™s health physiotherapy, Pilates classes and many more ([see class list](/classes.html)).

In addition to these physiotherapy services we provide nutritional screening, advice and assessments with Ruth Kilcawley (<a href="http://www.foodnutrition.ie">www.foodnutrition.ie</a>).

Our aim is to provide a centre of excellence for all your needs. We pride ourselves on providing a quality service with our highly qualified and experienced team.
