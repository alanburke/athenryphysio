#Megan Keane
Megan Keane offers pilates classes along with Rachel on a weekly basis.   
Megan works here and in the Galway Clinic.

I'm a fully certified APPI Pilates instructor, with additional training in Pilates for antenatal and postnatal populations. I qualified as a physiotherapist in 2007 and have a special interest in Women's Health, Men's Health and neurological conditions, working in various locations across Ireland, Australia and the UK.

I enjoy running, swimming and of course a good old Pilates class!
